  <h1> Interaction in p5*Js </h1>  
   </div>

  <div class="content">
  <p> Our last and final project was learning basics in p5*JS. I played around with several of the examples. I learned how to change its color and its shape. JS has so many components and is really specific with its order and command. It will take me a while to get used to this. p5Js and animation are super challenging! If you drag the cursor above the animation below, the shapes move differently. I tried to resize the image in both html and in css, but nothing worked. In between semesters I plan to dig deeper into p5Js. </p>

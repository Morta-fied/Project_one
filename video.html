    <p> We had two assignments we had to merge. In the first assignment, we had to collect sounds to create an audio story. For the second assignment, we had to use images to support the sounds we collected. The sounds I gathered were old school radio sounds and a recording of myself reading the back of the book <b><i>Mad World.</i></b> I used vocoder effects over my voice to give it an old school robot, electro sound. </p> <p> I couldn't think of or find a story I wanted to tell, so I chose to read the back of a book, as I mentioned. As I was reading it, in my mind, it sounded like a commercial. As a kid, I always dreamed of being on TV, so I put those two elements together to create a dream-like commercial for the book. Check out the video below!  </p>

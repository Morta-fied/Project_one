    <p>In this lesson, we learned how to create geometric shapes in Boxy SVG. I originally started a two-dimensional project in Adobe Illustrator because I was unfamiliar with both Illustrator and Boxy SVG. We then had a lesson in Boxy, and I created what I intended in my mind. Boxy made it easy to add effects to the shapes, which helped me tremendously.</p>
    <p> We learned about the different file types and how to support transparency for web browsers and the like. My designs were heavily influenced by the Memphis Design Group. There is a graphic designer I really like who does 3D shapes like this in Memphis Design style and I am really influenced by him, so I was really happy to learn Boxy SVG. I love that it has a training module which is extremely helpful. </p>

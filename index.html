       <p> Hi! My name is Mark Morta. I am an aspiring multimedia designer / artist. I was born in Anchorage , Alaska and raised in Northern California. I love the 1980's and 1990's visual aesthetics (If you can't already tell, haha.) I finally decided to pursue a degree in multimedia programming and design. School has been the most rewarding experience! When the pandemic hit, I lost my job like many others in retail. I had to make some quick decisions. My goal was to get the ball rolling in pursuing a degree in mulimedia programming and design before I turned 40 and here I am, 40 and the ball is rolling into my second year.</p> 
        

         <p> I have been afraid to go after this for the past two decades, and now here I am about to get my associates degree, my first goal. My next goal is to complete 4 years for a Bachelors. Sometimes I want to pinch myself to see if I'm dreaming. It's never too late to follow your dreams, they say, and I believe it more and more every day. I am proud to showcase the work I have done over the past year, so enjoy! </p>
